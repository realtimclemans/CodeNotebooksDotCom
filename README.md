# CodeNotebooks.com

CodeNotebooks.com will be an online library of free live editable CoCalc Jupyter notebooks. 

It'll use CoCalc.com's API to create CoCalc.com users and free projects with no internet access and later be switched to a self hosted fork of CoCalc to provide free internet access routed via a no-logging VPN. The switch will likely happen in six months when I raise the money to buy the yearly CoCalc Kubernetes MIT License yearly fee and pay for servers.

## Motivation

* CoCalc.com is extremely expensive. To provide internet access to a project we have to pay $1.64/month. For 2GB of ram, 2 vCPUs, 20GB disk is $9.01 on Scaleway.com. On CoCalc 1 shared CPU core, 1GB shared ram, 20GB of disk space, priority support, network access (outbound is trottled at unknown limit), member's hosting, always running, 2 dedicated cores, 2 dedicated ram for $402.26/month at 50% discount for students, teachers, academic researchers and hobbyists and for paying montly via Stripe.  
* CoColc has only three active developers. Two of them handle support. There is no other staff.

## Mission

* Make Science Technology Engineering and Math education, mentorship, certification and degree issuance, soft skills training, hiring assistance completely free with the highest employeement rate for graduates at > $100K/year base salary for entry level positions
* Completely elimate the use of all non-open-source software by funding the development, maintenance, support, and marketing of superior open source software

## How we'll give back to SageMath Inc.

* Open PRs upstream for all our CoCalc code
* Purchase yearly MIT License and significant support
* Pay SageMath Inc. 25% of our revune

## Expenses

* $500 for Stripe Atlas Delaware C Corporation formation which includes legal documents, formation of the company in Delaware, federal tax ID creation, stock issuance tool with standard terms, Stripe Atlas Community, Stripe account, discounts from Stripe partners, including up to $5,000 in free credits from Amazon Web Services and flat-rate packages from vetted providers of legal and tax services. 
* $200 for Washington State corporation filing fee
$ $60/year annual report for Washington State
* $35/year for City of Burien, Washington, United States business home occupation fee
* $708/year for ProductHunt's Ship Pro with $5,000 in Amazon Web Services credit, unlimited projects, unlimited messages, Clearbit enrichments, embed widget,
email form, subscriber import and export, product promotion, scheduled product launches, group messaging, private messaging, surveys and polls

Crawl Github.com and CoCalc.com and internet in general for .ipynb files. Convert webpages with code in them to Jupyter notebooks.

Delete spam and adult content.

Route all internet traffic through a no logging VPN so we don't get shut down when our service is abused.

Use https://github.com/sagemathinc/cocalc-kubernetes and pay Sagemath Inc. $1,499/year for MIT License and non-guaranteed support and host on Scaleway.com (very cheap) and apply for Scaleway's startup program.
