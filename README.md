# CodeNotebooksDotCom

CodeNotebooks.com will be an online library of live editable CoCalc Jupyter notebooks. It will have analytics, extensive meta-data, web crawler friendly HTML versions, show what people have done with a particular notebook, allow commenting, internet access, and allow embedding on any webpage. Be the medium.com of Jupyter notebooks. All edits are public. Charge for private use. Basically Github's original model where open source = free and private = pay.

Motivation:

* CoCalc.com is extremely expensive. For example 2gb of ram, 2 vCPUs, 20GB disk is $9.01 on Scaleway.com. On CoCalc 1 shared CPU core, 1GB shared ram, 20GB of disk space, priority support, network access (outbound is trottled at unknown limit), member's hosting, always running, 2 dedicated cores, 2 dedicated ram for $402.26 at 50% discount for students, teachers, academic researchers and hobbyists and for paying montly via Stripe.  
* CoColc has only three active developers

Mission: 

* Make Science Technology Engineering and Math education, mentorship, certification, soft skills training, hiring assistance completely free and better than any other provider
* Completely elimate the use of all non-open-source software by funding the development, maintenance, support, and marketing of superior open source software

How we'll give back to SageMath Inc.:

* Open PRs upstream for all our CoCalc code
* Purchase yearly MIT License and significant support
* Pay SageMath Inc. 25% of our revune

Crawl Github.com and CoCalc.com and internet in general for .ipynb files. Convert webpages with code in them to Jupyter notebooks.

Delete spam and adult content.

Route all internet traffic through a no logging VPN so we don't get shut down when our service is abused.

Use https://github.com/sagemathinc/cocalc-kubernetes and pay Sagemath Inc. $1,499/year for MIT License and non-guaranteed support and host on Scaleway.com (very cheap) and apply for Scaleway's startup program.
