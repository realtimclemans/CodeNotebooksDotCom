# LiveJupyterNotebooksDotCom

LiveJuputerNotebooks.com will be an online library of live editable CoCalc Jupyter notebooks. It will have analytics, extensive meta-data, web crawler friendly HTML versions, show what people have done with a particular notebook, allow commenting, internet access, and allow embedding on any webpage. Be the medium.com of Jupyter notebooks. All edits are public. Charge for private use. Basically Github's original model where open source = free and private = pay.

Crawl Github.com and CoCalc.com and internet in general for .ipynb files. Convert webpages with code in them to Jupyter notebooks.

Delete spam and adult content.

Route all internet traffic through a no logging VPN so we don't get shut down when our service is abused.

Use https://github.com/sagemathinc/cocalc-kubernetes and pay Sagemath Inc. $1,499/year for MIT License and non-guaranteed support and host on Scaleway.com (very cheap) and apply for Scaleway's startup program.
